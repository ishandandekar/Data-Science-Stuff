# This program is just to understand tranforms. There are no function which in any way will help in machine learning practically

# How to find if data is normal
# 1. sns.distplot() :- plots the distribution
# 2. pd.skew() :- returns the skewness of the distribution; if 0 then data is normal
# 3. QQ plot :- If all the points are on 45Â° line then data is normally distributed
