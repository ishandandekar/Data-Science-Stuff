You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset. She's going off about something that you said. 'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do.
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night. I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like, aAnd she'll never know your story like I do.
But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts. She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers. Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find, that what you're looking for has been here the whole time.
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you, been here all along. So, why can't you see? You belong with me, You belong with me.
We're no strangers to love. You know the rules and so do I (do I). A full commitment's what I'm thinking of, you wouldn't get this from any other guy.
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling, gotta make you understand.
Never gonna give you up. Never gonna let you down. Never gonna run around and desert you. Never gonna make you cry. Never gonna say goodbye. Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.
I'm a Barbie girl, in the Barbie world. Life in plastic, it's fantastic. You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere. Imagination, life is your creation.
